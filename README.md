# Bitcoin LSTM

 *This is repository containing the project for bitcoin price prediction using LSTM.
 The difference between the original project from MEDIUM and my custom code is that
 since the dataset was live(updated on a daily basis) so in order to get the best result
 and train it for latest data I have automated the code and connected it using yfinance
 to get latest data and train it.
 *In addition to that the code implements Principle COmponent Analysis to decrease complexity
 of code and helps inn providing better results
